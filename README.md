# ðŸ–¥ Personal Portfolio 2023 - August

Samanta "Sami" Moya Medina

## ðŸ”– What I've used and what I'm learning

I'm using libraries I'm comfortable with but also want to learn new CMS' and HTML preprocessors.

- Getting more used to Nunjucks
- Comfortable with NetlifyCMS --> Explored Strapi CMS --> Settling into Sanity Headless CMS
- Confortable with 11ty static site generator --> I could be better! Sticking to it.
- Using some super basic Webpack bundling to keep...
- using GSAP's libraries that are only accessable through node packages!
- & maybe I'll peek into a lightbox, smoothscroll, or other things along the way.
